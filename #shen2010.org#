** Time discretizations and their stability analysis

construct time discretization schemes 
which satisfy a discrete energy law (类似于2.21)

采用 Allen-Cahn phase-field system 5-10-18:

$$ \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial \t} + v \cdot \Delta v 
= \gamma (\nabla ^2 \phi - f) $$


first reformulate the system 5-10-18
