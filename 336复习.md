As I mentioned in class, through this discussion post I am providing an overview of types of problems on the final exam. HW4 was essentially a review exercise to help/force you practice for the final exam. The exam will have 5-6 questions on the following topics:

1-2) There will be two sets of True/False and/or multiple choice questions on the theory (fluid mechanics, mass transport, multiphysics models) and second half (numerical methods) of the course, respectively.  All choices must be justified with a 1-2 sentences, partial credit will be given for incorrect answers with justifications that show some understanding of the problem. No credit will be given for answers without justifications.

3) Hydrostatics - much like the homework you will need to use the hydrostatic form of the Navier-Stokes eqns to solve a problem similar to those in HW4. There will be no numerical methods content in this question.

4) Hydrodynamics - much like in the homework you will need to use the hydrodynamic form of Navier-Stokes eqns to solve a problem similar to those in HW4. There will be no numerical methods content in this question.

5) Multiphysics I (convective heat transfer) - this problem will involve the description of a single-component process with both **flow and heating/cooling**. You will be expected to select the appropriate equations and boundary conditions from the formula sheet, perform **scaling analysis** with the intent of **reducing the dimensionality** of the domain, and formulating a linear or nonlinear system of equations resulting from the use of the **MWR or MOL**.

6) Multiphysics II (convective mass transfer) - this problem will involve the description of a two-component process with both **flow and mass transfer (reaction/diffusion)**. You will be expected to select the appropriate equations and boundary conditions from the formula sheet, perform **scaling analysis** without the intent of reducing dimensionality of the domain, and **predicting the performance** of the process given a set of material and operating parameters using **dimensionless parameters** from the scaled equations.


Firstly, I'm assuming that we want our reaction to go to completion towards the end of the channel. From the first equation, we see that our change in A due to reaction is related to Da. Therefore, do we want Da >> Re and Da >> (Pe_m)^-1 so that the main contribution to our change in A is from reaction, as opposed to convection?

Would we also require that v\_s / L to be similar to k? I assume that if v\_s / L << k then our reaction wouldn't have time to go to completion, whereas if v_s / L >> k then our reaction would go to completion very early, and our design would be inefficient since we have a lot of channel where nothing's really going on.

I'm not really sure what else to say for Re and Pe\_m... I know that Re is related to turbulence while Pe\_m is related to the ratio of convective to diffusive transport, but I'm not really sure which of these regimes are considered good for a microreactor.

Am I on the right track for this question, and/or is there anything really important that I'm overlooking?


This question is a bit tricky and there are many possible answers that would get full credit. Regarding reaction conversion, the value of Da does relate to the rate of reaction and, consequently, the reaction conversion in the channel. However, the value of t\_s that was used in the scaling is not related to how long the mixture resides in the channel and undergoes reaction. The t\_s is instead the hydrodynamic timescale which is very very small. This situation is good from the perspective of simulations, we want to perform our time-stepping constrains by the smallest time-scale for accuracy.

To make a long story short, there are two answers which I would accept regarding reaction conversion. If you plug in the values as-is, Da will be relatively small and which would lead one to believe that reaction conversion is minimal. That is OK from the perspective of grading the exam, but another answer that shows a deeper understanding of the problem would be to determine the approximate residence time x\_s/v\_s in the channel and use that for the time-scale in Da.

The second part of the question is simple, just note that the volumetric flowrate may be approximated by multiplying v_s by the cross-sectional area of the channel, H^2.
