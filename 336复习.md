As I mentioned in class, through this discussion post I am providing an overview of types of problems on the final exam. HW4 was essentially a review exercise to help/force you practice for the final exam. The exam will have 5-6 questions on the following topics:

1-2) There will be two sets of True/False and/or multiple choice questions on the theory (fluid mechanics, mass transport, multiphysics models) and second half (numerical methods) of the course, respectively.  All choices must be justified with a 1-2 sentences, partial credit will be given for incorrect answers with justifications that show some understanding of the problem. No credit will be given for answers without justifications.

3) Hydrostatics - much like the homework you will need to use the hydrostatic form of the Navier-Stokes eqns to solve a problem similar to those in HW4. There will be no numerical methods content in this question.

4) Hydrodynamics - much like in the homework you will need to use the hydrodynamic form of Navier-Stokes eqns to solve a problem similar to those in HW4. There will be no numerical methods content in this question.

5) Multiphysics I (convective heat transfer) - this problem will involve the description of a single-component process with both flow and heating/cooling. You will be expected to select the appropriate equations and boundary conditions from the formula sheet, perform scaling analysis with the intent of reducing the dimensionality of the domain, and formulating a linear or nonlinear system of equations resulting from the use of the MWR or MOL.

6) Multiphysics II (convective mass transfer) - this problem will involve the description of a two-component process with both flow and mass transfer (reaction/diffusion). You will be expected to select the appropriate equations and boundary conditions from the formula sheet, perform scaling analysis without the intent of reducing dimensionality of the domain, and predicting the performance of the process given a set of material and operating parameters using dimensionless parameters from the scaled equations.
