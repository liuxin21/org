* chapter10

** Recall: 1:1 salt, planar geometry, low potential approx
psi = psi0 * exp(-k(c0)*x)

more ions close to the surface:
difference in osmotic pressure 渗透压

** surface potential psi0
measure the charge density (sigma)
1. titration
2. surface excess
3. stoichiometry 化学计量

** surface charge
surface charge + charge in solution = 0
therefore, sigma = -int rho dx
回到之前的poisson: D(psi,x) = F(rho) 带入上式
sigma = - epsilon d(psi,x=0)


** Grahame equation
(surface charge) sigma = epsilon * psi0 / d(c0)

* chapter11

** capacity 
C = Q/psi
CA = C/A = (Q/A)/psi = sigma / psi = epsilon / d(c0)

对比普通的capacitor c = epsilon A / d
说明：
1. the electric double layer behaves like a plate capacitor
2. the distance between the plates is given by the debye length


** limitations of the pb theory

1. the finite size of the ions is neglected (具体计算？)
2. ions in solution
